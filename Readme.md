“Insights Beyond Logs: Enhancing Security with Advanced Analytics”



Problem Statement - In today's online environment, keeping websites safe from cyber threats is more crucial than ever. Yet, understanding and responding to the vast amount of log data generated by websites can be overwhelming. Existing tools often fall short in quickly identifying and addressing security risks, leaving websites vulnerable to attacks. What's needed is a user-friendly log analysis system that can sift through website logs efficiently, spotting unusual activity, and alerting website owners to potential threats before they escalate. This solution aims to provide peace of mind for website owners by offering robust protection against cyber threats in a simple and accessible way.

Solution - A Webapp  through which you can handle all of your company’s log data and gain analysis , threats notifications as well as solution with help of AI​ , in a better User Interface and User Friendly environment . 


Flow -
1] Log Data Gathering , uploading .
2] Cleaning and preprocessing of the Data .
3] Feature Extraction .
4] Analysis via various AI Models .
5] Solution Provided .
6] Integrating anomaly detection models via various NLP Models .





Proposed Solution - 

As technology evolves, so do the threats faced by websites, including SQL injection, DoS attacks, cross-site scripting, and more. To combat these threats effectively, we've devised an advanced solution leveraging log data analysis. While website log data is traditionally understood only by developers, we're revolutionizing this process by enhancing its user interface, making it accessible to all. Our innovation lies in automating the analysis process using AI. We've incorporated two NLP models, ChatGPT 3.5 and Llama, to decipher log data and detect potential threats. ChatGPT 3.5, a pre-trained software, delivers tailored outcomes based on user inputs, while the fine-tuned Llama model understands project-specific nuances. By harnessing these models, we transform complex log data into easily digestible insights presented through intuitive visualizations like bar graphs and pie charts. This approach ensures a user-friendly experience, empowering users to proactively address website security concerns with confidence.

USP’S 
a)  Anomaly Analysis using Machine learning algorithms .
- Use of Isolation forest , K-Means clustering ,  LOF Outliers factors and time series analysis algorithms .

b) Detection of Anomalies and possible resolving techniques .
-ChatGPT 3.5 and Llama, to decipher log data and detect potential threats. ChatGPT 3.5, a pre-trained software, delivers tailored outcomes based on user inputs, while the fine-tuned Llama model understands project-specific nuance

c) Securing Users data -  Using Fernet symmetric encryption technique to encrypt data .It is an AES ( Advanced Encryption standard ) method which provides strong security .
Conclusion   -
Despite time constraints, our team efficiently managed tasks and collaborated effectively.
Technical challenges such as model integration and accuracy optimization were overcome through meticulous planning and collective effort.
Despite moments of fatigue, team morale remained high through mutual support and encouragement.
